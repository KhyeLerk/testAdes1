## Justifications

### Justification 1

![Photo1](https://github.com/ADES-FSP/jibaboom-2b22-astronomia/blob/master/worksheets/wireframes/assets/advance_mobile_result_viewer_1.jpg)

#### Good Points

1. Indication of day for column-wise header can be replaced with performance id to display the results
2. "January 2016" header is a perfect spot to be replaced with festival id of the result being computed
3. Navigation bar at the bottom can be used to navigate throughout the application
4. Color coded performances can be used to indicate the flow of performances to be watched
5. Performances in the table contains additional space to indicate popularity if needed

#### Bad Points

1. No space to enter input of additional performances to be computed
2. Row-wise header is small and hard to accurately indicate the start and end time of each performances
3. Usually, time is display as column-wise header, might be uneasy for first time user of the application

### Justification 2

#### Good Points

1. Indication of day for column-wise header can be replaced with performance id to display the results
2. "January 2016" header is a perfect spot to be replaced with festival id of the result being computed
3. Color coded performances can be used to indicate the flow of performances to be watched
4. Performances in the table contains additional space to indicate popularity if needed

#### Bad Points

1. No space to enter input of additional performances to be computed
2. Row-wise header is confusing as the start time and end time is not clearly displayed ( 9am stands for 9 am to 10 am or 8 am to 9 am? )
3. Usually, time is display as column-wise header, might be uneasy for first time user of the application

### Justification 3

#### Good Points

1. Well compiled to show the data instead of using a table
2. Start time and end time can be clearly seen 
3. Vertical blue bar in the 2nd row can be easily used as indication of performances to be watched
4. "Lesson ?" for each row can be replaced with popularity instead
5. Bold text of each row can be replaced with performance id to indicate clearly that it is a separate row
6. Top navigation bar can be used as a quick change of pages to compute for different festivals

#### Bad Points

1. No space to enter input of additional performances to be computed
2. Vertical blue bar as to show result of computations might not be suitable as the user might expect a more clearer indication such as color coding the whole row (However since the fonts are black in color, color coding with darker color to show clearer view of result is not possible as it will clash with the black color making data unclear)
3. If further addition of features are to be added, the UI is hard to implement and find places to include it
4. User unable to see the flow of performances to be watched as compared to the schedule table method of displaying the result
